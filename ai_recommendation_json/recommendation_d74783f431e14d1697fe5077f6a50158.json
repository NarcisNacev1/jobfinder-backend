It was a huge surprise to receive an offer and make it all happen.My first projects were in different stages and on different levels of experience needed. However, I was not hesitant to jump on them!

Being able to work on projects within different stages of development allowed me to learn the full cycle fairly quickly and progress in a speedy mode!With the vast experience from the 3 projects, I continued my growth by joining Business Development (BD) - and that's when my career took a massive turn. After learning all the basics, I was made a Key Account Manager of 5 different accounts at scandiweb.The best things I have learned and gained thanks to scandiweb? Self-confidence and believing in my experience. They allowed me to grow at my own pace and gave me an enormous amount of trust.
