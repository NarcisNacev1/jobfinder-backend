I saw an ad for a Junior Project Manager position and since I was somehow in IT but with little experience, I decided to try it out. It was a huge surprise to receive an offer and make it all happen.My first projects were in different stages and on different levels of experience needed. However, I was not hesitant to jump on them! North Coast Pottery (US client), Stenders (LV client), and Hebes Code (Spanish client). Being able to work on projects within different stages of development allowed me to learn the full cycle fairly quickly and progress in a speedy mode!With the vast experience from the 3 projects, I continued my growth by joining Business Development (BD) - and that's when my career took a massive turn. After learning all the basics, I was made a Key Account Manager of 5 different accounts at scandiweb.The best things I have learned and gained thanks to scandiweb? Self-confidence and believing in my experience. They allowed me to grow at my own pace and gave me an enormous amount of trust. The freedom of being able to work within your own frames makes you feel like the processes are not there! All of the teams and managers I worked with, valued me for who I am, and leveraged my strengths to the best advantage.\"Dominika Plata, Key Account Manager from Poland. Joined the company on 4/3/2023.\"I was looking for a company working in a variety of technologies and frameworks related to eCommerce, and scandiweb was the best suitable for this. I remember my first project was Christmas Tree World in which we did a Magento 2 Fresh build with data migration from the old Magento 2 website.I had the opportunity to lead the project discovery calls with the client to finalize the requirements, analyze and document the proposed implementation, and provide a project work estimate. Getting a chance to be involved in all things discovery enhances your technical skills and develops interpersonal skills and client communication.I have learned that the best things on scandiweb are teamwork, handling responsibilities, and knowledge of eCommerce related technologies like iPaaS and PIM.\"Anup Wankhede, Key Account Manager from India.
